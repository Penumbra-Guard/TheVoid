Part One is to:

    Implement a Product Class
    Create an array of Product
    Display the Product array on the console

Implement a Product class with a constructor and three properties.

public class Product {  
  // Product constructor with three parameters (SKU, description, price)
  // SKU() method to return the SKU for the product
  // description() method to return the description for the product
  // price() method to return the price (in dollars) for the product - use a float data type
}

Implement a StoreUserInterface class that will create an array of Products and display a formatted list of the products in the array. 

public class StoreUserInterface {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    // declare a variable as an array of Product
    // create at least three instances of Product and add them to your array
         // myProducts[0] = new Product(101, "Crest Toothpaste", 2.49);
    // use a for loop to iterate over the array and print out each product
    // Sample output may be - Product: <sku> Description: <description> Price: <price>
        // Product: 101, Description: Crest Toothpaste, Price: $2.49
}

Be creative, this is your Store.  As long as you complete the man elements, feel free to embellish your project as you like.
